The model files tell MapTnSeq.pl what each read should look like.

If using the newer TnSeq protocol, with a two-stage PCR, use
model_pKMW3.2 for pKMW3-based Mariner libraries
model_pKMW7.2 for pKMW7-based Tn5 libraries
model_magic_mariner.2 for mariner libraries built with the magic pool approach

If using our original TnSeq protocol with a "universal" primer based on
the barcode priming site, use
model_pKMW3_universal for pKMW3-based Mariner libraries
model_pKMW7_U for pKMW7-based Tn5 libraries
model_magic_mariner for mariner libraries built with the magic pool approach
model_ezTn5_kanU for ezTn5 transpososome libraries such as Keio_ML9
model_ezTn5_Tet_Bifido for libraries built with ezTn5
  but with modified barcode flanking sequences

If using our original TnSeq protocol with the original primers, use
model_pKMW3 for pKMW3-based Mariner libraries
  (model_pHIMAR_kan is identical to model_pKMW3)
model_pKMW7 for pKMW7-based Tn5 libraries
model_ezTn5_kan1 for ezTn5 transpososome libraries such as Keio_ML9

The first line of the model file describes from the beginning of the
read to the junction between the transposon and the genome. For
model_pKMW3, this is:

nnnnnnCGCCCTGCAGGGATGTCCACGAGGTCTCTNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGACGGCCGGCCAGACCGGGGACTTATCAGCCAACCTGT

where the beginning nnnnnn means 6 random nucleotides and the 20 Ns
are the random barcode.

The second line of the model file is optional. It describes the
vector's sequence after the inverted repeat (that is, after where the
junction should be).  This allows MapTnSeq.pl to identify intact
vector that did not integrate into the target genome. For instance, in
pKMW3, this sequence is:

TATGTGTTGGGTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGAATTAATTCTTGAAGA
