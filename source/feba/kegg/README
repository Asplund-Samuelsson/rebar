This directory stores metadata about KEGG pathways, taken from the
MicrobesOnline database. See
	http://www.microbesonline.org/programmers.html#schema
for more information.

If you want to use the maps themselves, please download the images
(png format) into the maps/ subdirectory.  These should be available
from the KEGG ftp site, see

http://www.genome.jp/kegg/download/Readme/README.pathway

This directory also includes information about ModelSEED reactions so
as to link SEED roles to KEGG reactions. These were obtained from the
ModelSEED or from the DOE systems biology knowledgebase.
